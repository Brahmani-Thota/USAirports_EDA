I have taken a dataset regarding the US Airport Statistics which has 7 columns containing airport name, destination, departures, revenues through mail. This dataset contains about 135 rows and the size is about 12KB. I am looking forward to knowing the average departures per city, the most number of airports used and the most number of destinations reached.  I have understood this dataset as this is one of the common topics. I found this dataset on International Journal on the Teaching and Learning of Statistics. I tried searching for the datasets for airports and I have got this dataset. This dataset is free and is used for research purposes only.
